    <b>Kunal Sanklecha<hr></b>
   <P> A Mumbai-based mountaineer and trekking guide, Kunal Sanklecha seeks to inspire travellers to experience a place through its people, by interacting with locals on a journey and choosing homestays wherever possible. 
    One of his favourite places is Garbett Plateau, a steep trek that opens to a stunning view of Matheran; though he has done it hundreds of times in the past few years, each journey brings fresh perspective. 
    Sanklecha enjoys exploring the bridge between self-development and travel and encourages on his nature treks to look inward as well. Top tip: “Use travel as a medium for self-growth.”</P>

  <b>Prem Sagar<hr></b>

    A love for literature and mythology is what drove Prem Sagar to become a tour guide. With a master's degree in English literature, he ran a bookstore in McLeodganj, Dharamshala where he chatted about local history and 
    culture with the foreign travellers who dropped in. The casual conversations led him to start his own trekking agency, Eagle’s Height
    Hikers and Trekkers. Sagar now takes people on historical tours and heritage walks around Himachal Pradesh, as well as trekking 
    expeditions and safaris beyond. Top tip: "Each place is multi-faceted. The history, the culture, the unique stories, there is a lot to a sight."

   <b> Anwar Wain<hr></b>
    
    In the pre-Covid days, Anwar Wain would relish in taking tourists around Gulmarg every single day, sometimes for 12 hours at a stretch. 
    The sole breadwinner of his family, he kept his chin up when business was slow in 2020 and patiently waited for the tide to change. 
    He encourages tourists to pave their own path and explore lesser-visited destinations like Doodhapatri, Alpather Lake and Drang for
    their majestic landscapes. Top tip: "Explore more than the gondola rides—it's just a slice of what Gulmarg has to offer"

    He takes travellers in a jeep around the city for an “urban safari”, one of Khaki Tour’s most popular offerings.

    lesser-known stories. Khaki Tours also organises food trails, photo walks and sailing tours. Top tip: "More than the sights, it's the stories
    that make Mumbai special."
